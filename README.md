# ☀️ sunshine 📲

sunshine is a handy SMS service that delivers three vital pieces of information directly to your phone: the weather for your area, today's top news headlines, and your upcoming homework assignments. 

## features 🌟

### 1. weather forecast 🌦

Get to know the weather conditions in your area, so you can plan your day better! 
sunshine provides:

### 2. news headlines 📰

stay informed about what's happening around the U.S. with just a text message! sunshine gives you the top headlines for the day.

### 3. canvas assignments 📚

stay on top of your school work. sunshine pulls your assignments from Canvas and tells you how many hours you have until they're due. with this sense of urgency, you'll be compelled to start your assignments!

## why?

I was too lazy to read everything. I didn't even know affirmative action got rolled back until my girlfriend told me. plus, sometimes I would dress for hot weather but it's cold as f**k outside. that's my fault, but maybe some people are like me too. also, because I have many classes, I don't really know what's due or not. so, I made sunshine.

## how?

we addressed the lack of information problem by compressing everything you need to know in a day (which are all togglable!) into one text message at any time in the morning.
the back-end was made using purely Python. JS/TS controls the settings page, and JS/TS sends information back to my MongoDB database. 

#### detailed:
Python: api req, parsing and translation, sms, twilio
JavaScript/TypeScript: handling landing page, settings page, userbase
MongoDB: handling userbase

## Notes
if you were a fan of my anti-procrastinator project, that was just combined in this
