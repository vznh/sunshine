## why?

I was too lazy to read everything. I didn't even know affirmative action got rolled back until my girlfriend told me. Plus, sometimes I would dress for hot weather but it's cold as f**k outside. That's my fault, but maybe some people are like me too. Also, because I have many classes, I don't really know what's due or not. So, I made sunshine.

## how?

The back-end was made using purely Python. JS/TS controls the settings page, and JS/TS sends information back to my MongoDB database. 

#### detailed:
Python: api req, parsing and translation, sms, twilio
JavaScript/TypeScript: handling landing page, settings page, userbase
MongoDB: handling userbase
